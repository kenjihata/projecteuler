**Retrospective Problem Optimization Ideas and Challenges for the Future**

- Problem 13: Instead of using python bigint, develop a method for addition by strings to handle integer overflow

- Problem 17: Instead of computing each of the words individually, calculate the number of times each phrase (e.g 'twenty' or 'hundred') is used between the lower and upper bounds. Spends less time redundantly computing the same phrases ('twenty-two', 'twenty-three').

- Problem 20: Instead of using python bigint, develop a method for multiplication by strings to handle integer overflow
